As an undergrad student I found a lot of deep tech interesting, specifically autonomous driving systems and computational physics. I have always been fuelled by two primary research goals:

- Developing efficient and intelligent navigation technology, learning to mitigate dynamic uncertainties and planning safer, faster paths for autonomous vehicles

- Contributing to the future of particle physics, delving into its software applications, and developing efficient algorithms that can improve the analysis and interpretation of high-energy physics data

As I approach my final semester, I find myself looking back at the past 3 years at university. Its definitely been an amazing and eventful experience, the good, the bad and the ugly. And if I could go back I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want anything to be different. I’ve been blessed with opportunities to tinker around with cool projects, like autonomous drones and self-driving cars, and immerse myself in high-performance computing compiler technology. In this post, I hope to shed some light on the world of software development in deep tech and share my experiences and insights, especially for those who are new or aspiring to enter this world.

### The Road Less Travelled
Embarking on a journey in deep tech is akin to traversing a labyrinth filled with mysteries and challenges. I found myself stretched between understanding theoretical frameworks and applying them to solve real-world problems in AI, Robotics, and Scientific Computing.

My experiences ranged from developing autonomous robots at the AI and Robotics lab, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, to extending the Numba JIT compilation support for a Python-C++ bindings generator as a GSoC developer. Each endeavor demanded a blend of creativity, problem-solving and persistence. There are good days and bad days but as long as you keep at it, the results will eventually come.

### Some Takeaways
**Embrace the learning curve:**
   Different recipes work for different people. But regardless of your background, delve into current research and strive to understand the underlying principles of the technologies you are working with. My time with CERN-HSF was a pivotal moment for me, revealing the profound interconnections in the fabric of reality and opening the door to deeper knowledge in computational physics and high-performance computing.

**Solve problems:**
   Every project brings unique challenges. Developing a lane awareness module for a self-driving car or working with compiler technology both demanded a methodological approach to problem-solving.

**Work Hands-On:**
   Practical experience is paramount. Participating in GSoC exposed me to advanced computing environments and allowed me to contribute to high-level software development, enhancing my coding abilities and understanding of software development tools and their real-world applications.

**Communication is your friend:**
   Interactions with mentors and peers can significantly augment your knowledge and perspective. The conversations I had during my stint at CERN-HSF were enlightening, leading to a richer understanding of high-performance computing.

### Tips?
For anyone already in the tech space, I may not the best person to ask for tips since I am myself only an undergraduate. But for those of you who are just entering university and want some advice -

**Start Small and Be Curious:**
   I felt that starting with smaller projects and progressively taking on more complex ones was a more sustainable approach to progress. Stay curious, ask questions, and try to understand the why behind every concept. 

**Cultivate a Multidisciplinary Approach:**
   The convergence of diverse fields like AI and Physics can lead to groundbreaking innovations. Being part of interdisciplinary teams definitely broadened my view and helped me explore and integrate knowledge from various domains

**Engage with the Community:**
   Participate in open-source contributions and interact with like-minded individuals. The exchange of ideas can provide fresh perspectives and valuable insights.
   The exchange of sweet linux/IDE tips are an added bonus too :)

**Never Stop Learning:**
   The field of technology is ever-evolving. Research moves so fast today that continually updating your skills and knowledge is really important. Balancing my time between upskilling/learning new stuff and staying productive at an internship is a pretty huge challenge. I try to vary my commitment to each in phases, I would upskill less when I am pressed for progress on a project but spend more time reading and learning during relatively relaxed work periods.

### Embracing the Journey
So far, my experience exploring software has been one of perpetual learning and discovery. The analysis and interpretation of high energy physics data, the intricacies of autonomous systems, and the innovations in high-performance computing have been constant sources of motivation for me.

It is crucial to remember passion and embrace the journey with an open and eager mind. A lot of external pressures like financial security and job-safety will be an important factor in this process, but I think as long as you stick to that passion, everything else will work out. The realm of science and tech is vast and ever-evolving, and the opportunities for learning and contribution are boundless.

### Conclusion
Breaking into the world of deep tech isn't simple. It’s a dynamic experience filled with ups and downs, breakthroughs, and slumps. But the rewards? Absolutely worth it. The knowledge acquired, the skills honed, and the satisfaction of contributing to advancements in technology and science are unparalleled.
