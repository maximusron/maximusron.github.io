I always admired what CERN built as a research institution, and its role in the advancement of science and technology. The Hadron collider strikes me as the first thing most people think about when they hear CERN. I was 10 years old when the Higgs Boson was discovered at the LHC, I definitely read about it in the papers but never really dove into what it means. Approaching high school with a fascination in theoretical physics, all I knew was that we discovered a particle that the Standard Model predicted.

Everything around us is made up of an infinite number of particles.
But when the universe began, no particles had mass; they all sped around at the speed of light.
Galaxies, stars, planets and life could only emerge because particles gained their mass from a fundamental field associated with the Higgs boson. The Higgs Field.

Weight is easy for us to understand since we've experienced a constant force of gravity for all our lives. But weight is a force and a force is caused by mass. Bigger things don't necessarily weigh more because they have less mass. If we were in space we would have no weight but our mass is obviously still there. I guess the big question is what is mass? I never reealised that a word we throw around so easily was one that was infinitely complicated. What is mass? I can intertwine my fingers and that feels like mass hitting another mass. But what makes it a solid object that my other finger can't pass through. They're atoms, we say. But the atoms have mass...

Whats the source? Where does it come from? An atom is a bundle of spinning electrons and a bunch of other subatomic particles. All these particles have energy. This energy gives it mass. So a simplification would be mass is energy?

The second you link mass to energy we realise that is exactly what Einstein formulated with 
$$ E = mc^2 $$
. Mass can be converted to pure energy, and and mass arises from some sort of stored energy. About 99% of the mass of an atom comes from the forces binding it together in the heart of its nucleus. 

I wish I would finish writing this but I need more coffee.
