Hi, I'm Aaron! a CS, AI & Robotics enthusiast. I believe in all things science and this blog documents my journey ^_^

I'm a computer science undergrad based in Manipal, India. I spend a lot of my time writing code and exploring software by working on some cool projects like self-driving cars and autonomous drones. My primary research interests lie in deep learning applications in robotics, high performance computing and computational physics. After completing my undergraduate studies, I aim to pursue a higher education and perform research.

Outside of work, I'm interested in photography, japanese art and cars. I'm also an amateur home chef who enjoys travelling and watching football.
