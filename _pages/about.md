Hi, I'm Aaron! a CS, AI & robotics enthusiast.

I'm a computer science undergrad based in Bangalore, India. I spend a lot of my time writing code and exploring software by working on some cool projects like self-driving cars and autonomous drones. I am currently a final year Computer Science major at Manipal Institute of Technology. My primary research interests lie in deep learning applications in robotics, high performance computing and computational physics. After completing my undergraduate studies, I aim to pursue a higher education and perform research.

Outside of work, I'm interested in photography, japanese art and cars. I'm also an amateur home chef who enjoys travelling and watching football.
